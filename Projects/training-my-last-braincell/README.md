# Training My Last Braincell

## Description

This is a bunch of small side projects. I want to share my notes and journey in Machine Learning with a from-scratch-hands-on-approach. I decided to take on C++ as a language to build my models in order to get as low level as possible. My thought process is that by having a very deep fundamental understanding and learning how to build everything from scratch at a low level, more complex models will be easier to debug and implement with the right tools in the future. Also, doing this from scratch in C++ seems pretty fun tbh.

### Perceptron_0

Implementation of a perceptron with a basic cost function. And weight calculation to approach to the correct.

### Perceptron_1

- Neurons have several inputs ( axes )
- They converge in a neuron 
- Neuron sums the inputs with a weight ( contained by the neuron )
  - Weight determines the "v" of the connection
Builds on top of Perceptron_0 by adding weight bias qnd
