# Training My Last Braincell

Credits To: [Tsoding Daily](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily) as I felt inpired by his guide and even borrowed the name for my repo.

## Description

These are the results of my independent study. I want to share my notes and journey in Machine Learning with a from-scratch-hands-on-approach. I decided to take on C as a language because performance is currently a top concern for me. My thought process is that by having a very deep fundamental understanding of how neural networks work and learning how to build everything from scratch, more complex models will be easier to debug and implement with the right tools in the future. Also, doing this from scratch in C seems pretty fun tbh.

### Perceptron_0

Implementation of a perceptron with a basic cost function. And weight calculation to approach to the correct.

### Perceptron_1

- Neurons have several inputs ( axes )
- They converge in a neuron 
- Neuron sums the inputs with a weight ( contained by the neuron )
  - Weight determines the "v" of the connection
Builds on top of Perceptron_0 by adding weight bias qnd
