        <li><p>Building Interactive Websites: I learned to use JavaScript as a programming language. This module also taught me how to make sites interactive with the use of JavaScript. I also learned to implement Github into my workflow. Finally, in this module, I also deployed my first <Link href='https://portfolio-site-theta-rose.vercel.app/' className='text-zinc-500 hover:text-zinc-300 transition-all underline'>portfolio-site concept.</Link> </p></li>

        <li><h2>Skills</h2></li>
        <li>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>My &quot;native&quot; programming language, I have worked with it for the past two years. I have used JavaScript in my front-end applications alongside React, Redux, and Next.Js. JavaScript is also my language of choice for backend and API integration. Furthermore, I use JavaScript to write unit and end-to-end test using Cypress.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>TypeScript</h3>
        <p>I started learning this superset of JavaScript in January of 2023 and have been using it since in all of my applications. I am since able to write type-safe reliable applications that have saved me from many headaches before launching to production.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Next.Js</h3>
      <p>Next.Js is the second framework I ever worked with (first one was Redwood.Js) and I immediately fell in love with. Its design patterns and workflow are really developer friendly. And I have gained a good amount of experience since I started using it in early January 2023 having developed all of my applications using Next since.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Technical writing</h3>
      <p>I enjoy technical writing. Mainly because I am able to write about the new things that I have learned and it helps me solidify my understanding. This has two pros, one I am able to reach an audience and teach useful information, and at the same time it serves as notes for me to go back on and quickly freshen up on a topic.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>TLDR; (Reddit Clone):</h3>
          <p>Created with Next.Js and next-auth. The app handles user authentication, stores the user session and 
          automatically handles token rotation in order to provide a seamless user-experience. The app uses the reddit api to fetch posts and offer 
          interactivity. On the backend, the text posts get processed in order to provide a summarized version in order save the user time and allow
          it to only retrieve the most useful information. The app is designed with the intent to reduce screen-time while still being able to browse
          your favorite app!</p>
        </li>
        {/* <li>
          <h3>E-Commerce</h3>
          <p>A Fullstack ecommerce implementation. The site offers a payment gateway, and the option to create an account. Accounts have added features such as
